During my sophomore year, I delved into the realm of computer science, immersing myself in the intricacies of AP Computer Science and data structures. One notable highlight was the Huffman Lab, authored by Brian Lavallee.

This repository encapsulates the culmination of my endeavors during that period, showcasing a diverse array of labs. Of particular significance is the inclusion of meticulously crafted code designed for Greenfoot, a platform that significantly enhanced my grasp of object-oriented programming principles. These coding exercises not only underscore my technical proficiency but also exemplify my commitment to mastering sophisticated concepts in the realm of computer science.
